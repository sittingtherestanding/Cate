				If I told you to memorize the first 25 digits of pi (3.141592653589793238462643) you would probably have a hard time. Human brains are not very good at remembering random numbers; they don't have enough meaning for us to really grasp them.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				If I told you to remember, in order, this list of random objects:
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				Meteor<br>Doll<br>Bench<br>Lamb<br>Elf<br>Pick-up<br>MnM<br>Fortune<br>Chair<br>Ammo
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				You would do better. These objects mean a lot more to you than digits of pi. But if I told you to memorize that list, and then you imagined pictures in your mind to link all of those items together, you wouldn't have any problem at all. And you could retain that list indefinitely. This is what is called the "Link System" of mnemonics. Let me show you.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				First, we need to link Meteor, to Doll. To do this, imagine a huge meteor shower; millions of meteors falling to Earth, now replace all of the meteors with giant dolls. A giant doll shower. Make sure you really see this image in your mind. Close your eyes and picture it. Do this with all of these images.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				Next, Doll to Bench. Imagine a little girls room filled with dolls, now make it filled with benches instead, as she goes to bed she snuggles with this pile of wood and metal benches.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				Bench to Lamb. Imagine an army of lambs, millions of them, charging this city and eating all of the benches.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				Lamb to Elf. Imagine lambs trying to build toys in Santa's workshop.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				Elf to Pick-up. Imagine elves riding in pick-up trucks to deliver presents around the world.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				Pick-up to MnM. A pick-up made of MnMs, naturally being eaten by everyone as it's driven through town.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				MnM to Fortune. You win the lottery and get a billion MnMs.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				Fortune to Chair. The most ridiculously expensive chair possible. 10 stories tall, made of diamonds, emeralds, and gold.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				Chair to Ammo. You're shooting a gun, but instead of bullets coming out there's full-sized chairs.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				Now see if you can go through the list using your imagined pictures to help you. I'll give you the first one: Meteor. If you imagined good pictures you'll have no problem remembering the rest.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				Pretty cool huh? But here's the cooler part, that list of random objects you memorized can be decoded into the first 25 digits of pi using what's called the "Major System" of mnemonics. Our states and capitals mnemonic doesn't use the major system (cause we don't need to remember any numbers), just the link system, but if you want to learn the major system (it'll take you a few minutes) go to sittingtherestanding.com you will then know the first 25 digits of pi, and how to memorize any number in record time.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				The Link System has 4 basic rules to help you make good pictures:
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				1. Substitution<br>Replace one of the objects with the other. Like how we put dolls falling to Earth instead of meteors.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				2. Proportion<br>Make things ridiculously large, or small. Like the 10 story chair.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				3. Exaggeration<br>Have millions of the object, like the army of lambs eating benches.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				4. Action<br>Make your objects doing things, like riding around the world delivering presents.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #ff8598">
			<p>
				Good pictures generally use more than one of those rules.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "rule" style = "background-color: #c9d787">
			<p>
				As you go through the states and capitals mnemonic you may want to use some of your own pictures instead of what we suggest. That is totally fine, just follow these rules and you'll do great.
